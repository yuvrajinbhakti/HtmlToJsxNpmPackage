create folder with same name as of package 
npm init -y
create index.js file or if we want to create any file like app.js(then write your code in app.js and also export it ),  then go to package.json then change "main":"index.js" to "main":"app.js"
then run this command -> npm login then npm publish




Before publishing, you can test it locally by using npm link:
In your package folder:
npm link
In another project where you want to test it:
npm link my-npm-package
Now, you can require your package in that project:
const greet = require('my-npm-package');
console.log(greet('Yuvraj')); // Output: Hello, Yuvraj!



Once published, your package will be available on npm for anyone to install using:
npm install my-npm-package
